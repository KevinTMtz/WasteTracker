        "name": "Aluminium",
        "description": "In 2018, 3.9 million tons of aluminum municipal solid waste was generated. The total recycling rate for aluminum items was 34.9 percent. Aluminium is one of the most desirable metals in the world and is used in many industries such as transport, food, electronics and electrical power transmission and construction. It is also very popular to recycle because of its low energy needs and high scrap value.",

        "description": "Cardboard, also referred to as corrugated cardboard, is a recyclable material that is recycled by small and large scale businesses to save money on waste disposal costs. Cardboard recycling is the reprocessing and reuse of thick sheets or stiff multilayered papers that have been used, discarded or regarded as waste. Cardboard boxes are usually heavy-duty or thick-sheets of paper known for their durability and hardness. Examples of cardboard include packaging boxes, egg cartons, shoe boxes, and cereal boxes.",

In the United States in 2018, 12.3 million tons of glass were generated, 31.3 percent of which was recycled. Making new glass from recycled glass is typically cheaper than using raw materials.",

        "name": "Organic Waste",
        "description": "EPA estimates that 63.1 million tons of food waste was generated in the commercial, institutional, and residential sectors in 2018. Food cannot be recycled. However, throwing food into the trash is not the best management option. Food that ends up in landfills leads to methane emissions which contribute to climate change. EPA recommends reducing food waste by buying only what you need and by eating your leftovers. Composting is an environmentally-friendly method of food waste disposal. In 2018, about 4.1 percent of food waste was composted.",

        "description": "Paper makes up 23 percent of municipal solid waste (trash) generated each year, more than any other material. Americans recycled about 68 percent of the paper they used in 2018. This recovered paper is used to make new paper products, which saves trees and other natural resources. Most community or office recycling programs accept paper and paper products. Check what your community or office program accepts before you put it in the bin. Look for products that are made from recycled paper when you shop. Better yet, consider if you really need to print in the first place.",

        "description": "Fast fashion, when clothing brands renew their collections on a more frequent basis, encourages us to fill our cupboards with clothes that we never use, or that we use very rarely, and that we then get rid of. In addition to questioning our clothing buying habits, recycling appears to be an answer to counteract the millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases emitted by the textile industry each year.",
